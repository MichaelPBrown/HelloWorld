    <h2 style="color:#002244;">Records-Past and Present</h2>
    <p style="color:#002244;">The Seahawks have had some decent seasons over the past few years going mostly 10-X, some times 10-6 or 10-5</p>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#002244;">
    <h2 style="color:#69BE28;">Mistakes</h2>
    <p style="color:#69BE28;">Oh, this is a tough subject for the Seahawks, they have made big mistakes fairly recently, some of which include releasing the best player on the team and running a play in the superbowl that lost us the game, they also have made many smaller mistakes that didn't effect the team as much</p>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#69BE28;">
    <h2 style="color:#002244;">Ideas</h2>
    <p style="color:#002244;">The Seahawks have also had many ideas that have not played out, like trading away some of our players 2 years ago. However, they had great ideas this season like trading for Jadeveon Clowney and Luke Wilson.</p>
