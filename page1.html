    <p style="font-size:20px; color:#002244"><i>The new roster for the 2019 season consists of many returning veterans and also many new rookies, but also the departure of old players. We see returning WRs Tyler Lockett and Jaron Brown, QB Russell Wilson, and RBs Rashaad Penny and Chris Carson, there are also other returning veterans from different teams such as Luke Wilson (TE).<br><br> Even with that we have many new rookies such as D.K Metcalk and Jadeveon Clowney coming in fresh trying to learn the new style. Finally, we lost great people last year as well, consisting of Doug Baldwin and Kam Chancellor, they left and left massive shoes to fill for incoming players.</i></p>
